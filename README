Memory Allocation Simulation using First-Fit Algorithm

This C program simulates the memory allocation process using the first-fit algorithm. It takes input for the number and size of memory blocks and processes, and then allocates memory to processes based on their size and the availability of memory blocks.

## Usage

1. Open a C compiler or IDE that supports C code compilation.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a new or existing C file.
3. Compile and run the program.

### Input Instructions

1. Enter the number of memory blocks (bno).
2. Enter the size of each memory block.
3. Enter the number of processes (pno).
4. Enter the size of each process.

### Output

The program will display the allocation results for each process, showing the process number, its size, and the allocated block number. If a process is not allocated to any block, it will be indicated as "Not allocated."

## Code Explanation

The code follows these main steps:

1. Initialize the allocation array to keep track of block allocations.
2. Input the number and size of memory blocks.
3. Input the number and size of processes.
4. Allocate memory to processes using the first-fit algorithm.
5. Display the allocation results.

## Optimization

The code has been optimized for readability and consistency.
